an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York City, Trump initially gained prominence in the 1970s as a real estate developer, taking over his family’s real estate business, which he renamed The Trump Organization. He expanded the company’s operations to include residential and commercial buildings, hotels, casinos, and golf courses, often branding them with his name.\\n\\nTrump became a well-known public figure through his ownership of the Miss Universe beauty pageants and his reality television show *The Apprentice* (2004–2015), which popularized his catchphrase, \"You\\'re fired!\" His business ventures, personal lifestyle, and outspoken personality made him a fixture in tabloid media and popular culture for decades.\\n\\nIn 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican, running on a populist platform that emphasized immigration restrictions, trade protectionism, and \"America First\" policies. He defeated several established politicians in the Republican primaries and went on to win the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, despite losing the popular vote. His presidency was marked by significant policy changes, including tax cuts, deregulation, and the appointment of conservative judges, as well as controversies related to his leadership style, use of social media, and allegations of misconduct.\\n\\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden but has continued to play a prominent role in Republican politics, repeatedly making unfounded claims of election fraud. He became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice: once in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his dealings with Ukraine, and again in 2021 for incitement of insurrection following the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nTrump remains a polarizing figure in American politics and has announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election.')], citations=None), usage=Usage(billed_units=UsageBilledUnits(input_tokens=8.0, output_tokens=441.0, search_units=None, classifications=None), tokens=UsageTokens(input_tokens=537.0, output_tokens=443.0), cached_tokens=480.0), logprobs=None)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dense retrieval example\n","Let’s take a look at a dense retrieval example by using Cohere to search the\n","Wikipedia page for the film Interstellar.
